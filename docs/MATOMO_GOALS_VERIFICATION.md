## Issues Found

**None!** All issues have been resolved.

### ✅ Previously Identified Issues (Now Fixed)

1. ✅ **Unused Goals:** Both `QR_CODE_SHARED` and `FIRST_API_CALL` are now fully implemented
2. ✅ **Documentation Discrepancies:** All documentation has been updated with correct goal IDs
3. ✅ **Missing Landing Page Goals:** All landing page goals are documented and implemented

---

## Recommended Actions

### ✅ Completed
1. ✅ All 17 goals are correctly configured in Matomo
2. ✅ Documentation updated with correct goal ID references
3. ✅ All missing goals have been implemented

### Medium Priority
1. Add test coverage for goal tracking functions
2. Add logging/monitoring for goal tracking success/failure rates
3. Create dashboard in Matomo to visualize goal conversions

### Low Priority
1. Consider adding additional milestone goals (100 QR codes, 10,000 scans, etc.)
2. Add revenue tracking to relevant goals where applicable
3. Implement A/B testing for goal triggering points

---

## Implementation Locations

All tracking functions are located in:
- **Main file:** `/src/lib/matomo-tracking.ts`
- **Configuration:** `/src/lib/matomo-config.ts`
- **Core functions:** `/src/lib/matomo.ts`
- **Documentation:** `/docs/MATOMO_TRACKING.md`, `/docs/MATOMO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

---

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ All 17 goal IDs match between Matomo and code
- ✅ 15 of 17 goals are actively tracked in code
- ⚠️ 2 goals defined but not implemented
- ⚠️ Documentation has incorrect ID mappings
- ✅ No duplicate or conflicting goal definitions
- ✅ Goal names and descriptions match Matomo instance
- ✅ Custom dimensions are properly mapped to goals

---

## Conclusion

The Matomo goals configuration is **well-structured and mostly complete**. The main issues are:
1. Two unused goal definitions that should be implemented
2. Documentation that needs to be updated with correct goal IDs

The implementation follows best practices with proper separation between client-side and server-side tracking, comprehensive custom dimensions, and clear naming conventions.

**Overall Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** with minor improvements recommended
