## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Account Setup
1. Go to Google Ads → Keywords → Negative keywords
2. Click "Add negative keywords"
3. Add account-level negatives
4. Set match type to "Broad match" for most terms

### Step 2: Campaign Setup
1. For each campaign, go to Keywords → Negative keywords
2. Add campaign-specific negatives
3. Use "Exact match" for very specific terms
4. Use "Phrase match" for terms that should never appear

### Step 3: Ad Group Setup
1. For each ad group, add relevant negatives
2. Focus on terms that are irrelevant to that specific ad group
3. Use "Exact match" for precision

## Match Type Guidelines

### Broad Match Negative Keywords
- Use for general terms that are never relevant
- Examples: "qr code scanner", "qr code reader"
- Will block variations and related terms

### Phrase Match Negative Keywords
- Use for terms that should never appear in that exact phrase
- Examples: "free qr code generator", "qr code generator free"
- More precise than broad match

### Exact Match Negative Keywords
- Use for very specific terms that are never relevant
- Examples: "qr-code-generator", "qr-code-monkey"
- Most precise, blocks only exact matches

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Weekly Tasks
1. Review Search Terms Report
2. Look for new irrelevant terms
3. Add high-impression, low-CTR terms as negatives
4. Check for terms with high cost but low conversions

### Monthly Tasks
1. Comprehensive review of all negative keywords
2. Remove negatives that might be blocking relevant traffic
3. Analyze performance impact of negative keywords
4. Update negatives based on new competitor analysis

### Tools and Reports
- **Search Terms Report**: Most important for finding new negatives
- **Keyword Planner**: Research related terms
- **Competitor Analysis**: Find new competitor terms to block
- **Performance Reports**: Measure impact of negative keywords

## Performance Metrics to Track

### Before/After Comparison
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Cost per click (CPC)
- Cost per conversion
- Quality score
- Impression share

### Key Indicators
- **Good**: CTR increases, CPC decreases
- **Bad**: Impression share drops significantly
- **Warning**: Conversions decrease (might be blocking relevant traffic)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Aggressive**: Don't add too many negatives at once
2. **Wrong Match Types**: Don't use exact match for broad terms
3. **Ignoring Performance**: Always monitor impact on conversions
4. **Set and Forget**: Negative keywords need ongoing optimization
5. **Blocking Relevant Terms**: Be careful with broad match negatives

## Advanced Strategies

### Seasonal Negatives
- Add holiday-specific negatives during peak seasons
- Block terms related to temporary trends
- Adjust based on current events

### Competitor Monitoring
- Regularly check competitor websites
- Monitor their ad copy for new terms to block
- Use tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs for competitor analysis

### Geographic Negatives
- Block terms in languages you don't serve
- Block terms for countries you don't target
- Use location-based negative keywords

## Emergency Procedures

### If CTR Drops Significantly
1. Check if negatives are blocking relevant traffic
2. Review search terms report for missed opportunities
3. Temporarily remove broad match negatives
4. Add more specific phrase match negatives instead

### If Conversions Decrease
1. Analyze conversion paths
2. Check if negatives are blocking high-intent users
3. Review negative keyword performance
