   Link to comparison blog post, share honest insights

5. **Email Your Network**
   Subject: "I built a QR code tool - feedback wanted"
   Body: Short, humble, link to your best blog post
   Ask for honest feedback (not sales pitch)

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

❌ **Don't:**
- Spam Reddit with links (get banned)
- Post "Check out my tool" without context
- Buy followers/traffic (waste of money)
- Ignore customer feedback
- Give up after 1 week (takes 3-6 months)

✅ **Do:**
- Provide genuine value first
- Answer questions helpfully
- Share knowledge generously
- Follow up with interested people
- Track what works and iterate

## REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

**Month 1:** 5-20 users (mostly from direct outreach)
**Month 2:** 20-50 users (blog traffic starts, word of mouth)
**Month 3:** 50-150 users (SEO kicks in, compounding effects)
**Month 6:** 200-500 users (if you execute consistently)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You'll know it's working when:**
- 3+ sign-ups per week without active promotion
- Blog posts rank on page 1 Google for target keywords
- Reddit/forums organically mention your tool
- Customers start referring friends
- You get inbound partnership requests

## MENTAL GAME

**Remember:**
- Every SaaS starts at zero users
- Consistency beats intensity
- Help 100 people, 10 will become customers
- Most people give up too early
- 6 months of daily effort = life-changing results
